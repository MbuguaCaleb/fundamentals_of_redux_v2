**State Management With Redux**
```
Redux is a state management tool that we can use in our projects

We can use it in react and also theoritically in other frameworks as well.

```
**PreparedNess**

```
(a)There is a lot of boiler plates in your project when it comes to redux but once you master the flow all goes well.

(b)There is dispatch,match state to props,actions,reducers.
```
**Advantage**
```
The biggest advantage is that in large applications using of state managers is of great benefit.

Redux is the most popular state Management tool with React.

```
**Concept of Redux**

```
The concept of redux is to entirely separate the state from being tied to one particular component and placing it such that it may be accessed universally by all components.

One of the challages of react is that it is one way->data being progresssively rendered to the related components .

What about if you need to access the state from an unrelated component??

This is wwhere application level state and state managers come in.


                     APP
                      |
                      |
[ SEARCH<----------MOVIE LIST-------->LOG IN    
                      |
                      |
                     MOVIE
```


```

Data in Redux is therefore completely separated from the components and you may pull it to the component tht needs the state.

It reduces the progressive passing of data via props which is very much handy when it comes to the Large Projects.
